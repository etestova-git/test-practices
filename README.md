# Best Test Practices

**Unit testing** is a type of automated testing. You can write unit tests without
using TDD or BDD, just by writing the tests after the production code.

**TDD** is a software development methodology, in which the developer writes
code in very short cycles, always starting with a failing test.

**BDD** can be thought of as a “flavor” of TDD, in which the application’s development is driven by its behavior, described in the forms of human-readable
requirements that must be later converted to executable tests.
