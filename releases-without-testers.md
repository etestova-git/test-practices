# How to release without QA engineer

1. Optimize release suites, always keep them in actual state
2. Ensure automation of all critical and high priority features 
3. Create monitoring and alerts on every release step/tasks
4. Analyse finished steps notifications (success/fail)
5. Alert the duty tester only if one or more tasks were not completed successfully
