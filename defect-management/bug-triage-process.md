# 🐞 Bug Triage Process Guide

Bug triage is a critical process in software development that ensures reported bugs are properly reviewed, prioritized, and assigned for resolution. This process helps teams manage defects efficiently and focus on fixing the most impactful issues.

## 📌 What is Bug Triage?

**Bug Triage** refers to the systematic evaluation of bugs to determine:
- The **validity** of the bug
- The **severity** and **priority**
- The **appropriate owner or team** to fix it
- The **timeline** for resolution

---

## 🧭 Key Goals

- Maintain a healthy backlog of bugs
- Focus on high-priority, high-impact issues
- Ensure bug reports are clear, reproducible, and actionable
- Prevent duplicate or outdated issues from cluttering the bug tracker

---

## 🔄 Typical Bug Triage Process

1. **Review New Bugs**
   - Check for completeness and clarity
   - Validate if the bug is reproducible
   - Close or reject invalid or duplicate bugs

2. **Assign Severity and Priority**
   - **Severity**: Technical impact on the system (e.g., crash, data loss)
   - **Priority**: Business importance and urgency

3. **Assign Ownership**
   - Determine the responsible team or individual
   - Ensure bugs are not unassigned or left idle

4. **Schedule for Resolution**
   - Add to appropriate sprint, milestone, or backlog
   - Consider deadlines, releases, and dependencies

5. **Track and Follow Up**
   - Monitor progress
   - Re-triage if new information emerges
   - Escalate blocking or critical issues

---

## 🧰 Best Practices

- Conduct regular triage meetings (e.g., weekly)
- Use tags and filters to categorize bugs (e.g., `UI`, `backend`, `security`)
- Keep communication open between QA, devs, and PMs
- Automate bug tracking with tools like Jira, GitHub Issues, Azure DevOps

## ✅ Roles Involved

| Role           | Responsibility                           |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| QA Engineer    | Reports and verifies bugs                |
| Developer      | Fixes assigned bugs                      |
| Product Manager| Decides on priority and business impact  |
| Triage Lead    | Facilitates the triage process           |

## 🧪 Example Severity vs. Priority Matrix

| Severity \ Priority | P1 (High)     | P2 (Medium)     | P3 (Low)      |
|----------------------|---------------|------------------|----------------|
| S1 (Critical)        | 🚨 Fix ASAP   | 🚨 Fix Soon     | 🔍 Review Later |
| S2 (Major)           | ⚠️ High Fix   | 🛠 Planned Fix   | 🕐 Backlog     |
| S3 (Minor)           | ✏️ Review     | 🗂 Triage Again  | ❌ Maybe Won't Fix |

## 📝 Summary

- Bug triage ensures efficient handling of defects
- Helps reduce technical debt and improve product quality
- Should be a routine, collaborative effort within the team
