## 🔍 2. Key Best Practices

- **Be concise but thorough**: Stick to facts, not assumptions.
- **Reproduce the issue at least twice**: Ensure it's consistent and not a fluke.
- **Prioritize clarity over cleverness**: Use plain, professional language.
- **Use standard templates**: Align with your team's bug reporting format (e.g., Jira, GitHub Issues, TestRail).
- **Log severity and priority**: Helps triage effort and risk.

## 🧠 4. Pro Tips

- Use `Ctrl + Shift + I` (DevTools) to inspect frontend or console errors
- Record the bug using screen capture tools
- Tag affected teams (e.g., Frontend, Backend, DevOps) when applicable
- Link related tickets (e.g., similar past bugs or dependencies)
- Retest the same scenario on a clean environment (to rule out cache/local data)
