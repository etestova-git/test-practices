# 📈 How We Increase Release Frequency: From 1 in 3 Months to 1 in 2 Weeks Without Loss of Quality

---

## 🧪 1. QA Process Improvements

### Shift-Left QA

- QA participated in requirements and design discussions.
- QA participated throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
- Developed and reviewed acceptance criteria before coding began.

### Testcases selection

- We prioritized test cases based on their impact and usage, with a focus on automating high-priority cases. 
- Manual work was focused on high-risk and critical paths.

### Definition of Done for Every New Feature

- Automated tests for high-priority cases written and passed
- Manual exploratory tests completed
- Regression testing done (by auto tests)
- Code reviewed and merged to the release branch

---

## 🤖 2. Test Automation Strategy

### Full Test Automation

Strict rule: all high-priority test cases of new features must be autometed

| Type | Running |
|------|----------------|
| **Unit Tests** | High coverage, run on every commit |
| **API Tests** | Automate critical endpoints (Postman) |
| **UI Tests** | Automate at least high-priority scenarios (Selenium, Cucumber, C#) |
| **Smoke Tests** | Automated tests for each deploy |
| **Regression Tests** | Everyday and on-demund runs |

### Test Runs

- Unit and smoke tests for every pre-merge
- UI + integration for everyday and on-demund runs
- Full regression before production releases

---

## CI/CD Pipeline Optimization

### ✅ Implement CI/CD Tools

- Use **Jenkins**, **GitHub Actions**, **GitLab CI**, or **TeamCity**
- Trigger builds on pull requests and merges
- Run automated tests in each pipeline stage

### ✅ Use Build Stages

```
Build → Unit Tests → API/UI Tests → Deployment to Staging → Smoke Tests → Approval → Production
```

### ✅ Enable Parallel Test Execution

- Split test suites by tags or components
- Use cloud-based test runners (e.g., Sauce Labs, BrowserStack)

### ✅ Integrate Quality Gates

- Fail builds on test failures or low code coverage
- Use tools like **SonarQube** for static analysis

---

## 📦 4. Environment and Data Management

### ✅ Use Stable Test Environments

- Keep staging environments consistent with production
- Automate infrastructure provisioning (e.g., with Terraform)

### ✅ Automate Test Data Management

- Use factories or API setups instead of UI
- Clean up test data after runs

---

## 🔁 5. Release Process Transformation

### ✅ Adopt Trunk-Based Development

- Merge small, frequent changes to `main`
- Use feature toggles to deploy incomplete features safely

### ✅ Create a Release Checklist

- Automated test suite status
- Manual exploratory test confirmation
- Changelog review
- Rollback plan

### ✅ Automate Release Creation

- Auto-generate release notes from PRs
- Tag releases from CI/CD

---

## 👥 6. Team Collaboration

### ✅ Improve Communication

- Use release dashboards
- Post status updates in Slack/Teams

### ✅ Cross-Functional Reviews

- QA, Dev, Product, and Ops sign off together
- Retrospectives after each release to refine process
