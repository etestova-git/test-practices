# üì± Mobile Testing Guide

This page provides an overview of best practices for mobile app testing, 
including device selection, 
the role of emulators and simulators, 
core testing areas, 
and using Charles Proxy.

## üîç 1. How to Choose Mobile Devices

### ‚úÖ Key Criteria:
- **OS Versions:** Test across different major versions of Android and iOS (e.g., iOS 17, Android 14, etc.)
- **Device Models:** Prioritize popular and widely used devices (check market data)
- **Screen Sizes & Resolutions:** Include both small and large screen sizes to test responsive behavior
- **Hardware Capabilities:** Devices with different RAM, CPU, and GPU capabilities
- **Manufacturers & Brands:** Samsung, Google Pixel, Xiaomi, OnePlus, iPhone (multiple generations)
- **Network Types:** Test over WiFi, 3G, 4G, 5G to simulate real usage

### üì± Compatibility Testing
- **Device Coverage:** Define a "device matrix" in collaboration with the Product Manager based on analytics. Include top devices like iPhones, Samsung Galaxy, and Google Pixel with OS versions such as iOS 15‚Äì17 and Android 12‚Äì14.
- **Screen Size & Resolution:** Ensure no layout issues on small and large screens.
- **Execution Strategy:** Combine physical devices with cloud testing farms (e.g., Sauce Labs, BrowserStack) for broader coverage.

---
- Cloud tools of real devices **Firebase Test Lab**, **BrowserStack**, **Sauce Labs**.
- Maintain a **device matrix** for the product or a fiture.

## üß™ 2. Emulators vs. Simulators

### üíª Emulators (Android)
- Mimic both software and hardware of real Android devices
- Provided by Android Studio (AVD Manager)
- Good for functional and UI testing
- Slower than real devices

### üì± Simulators (iOS)
- Simulate the iOS environment (software only)
- Provided by Xcode
- Cannot test hardware-specific features (e.g., camera, GPS)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations:
- **No real hardware behavior** (e.g., CPU throttling, battery drain)
- **No realistic performance data**
- **Limited support for gesture, touch, and physical sensors**

### ‚úÖ Use Real Devices For:
- Final verification
- Performance and battery testing
- Hardware-specific feature testing

## üß© 3. What to Test in Mobile Apps

### üîß 1. Functional and UI/UX Testing
- **User Flow Validation:** Test end-to-end flows (e.g., registration ‚Üí search ‚Üí add to cart ‚Üí checkout).
- **UI Element Interaction:** Verify all UI elements (buttons, toggles, inputs) are responsive.
- **Gesture Testing:** Validate tap, double-tap, long press, swipe (all directions), pinch-to-zoom.
- **Platform Consistency:** Ensure the app aligns with iOS Human Interface Guidelines and Android Material Design principles.

### üîÑ 2. Interruption and Connectivity Testing
- **Interruption Scenarios:**
  - App behavior during phone calls, texts, and notifications
  - Impact of plugging/unplugging the charger
- **Network Testing:**
  - **Offline Mode:** App stability and messaging with no internet
  - **Throttling:** Use Charles Proxy or developer tools to simulate 3G, weak WiFi, or flaky signals

### üß™ 3. Non-Functional Testing
- **Performance:**
  - App launch time from cold start
  - Monitor memory and CPU with Xcode Instruments and Android Profiler
- **Battery Consumption:** Evaluate for power efficiency
- **Security:**
  - Secure local data storage (no plain-text tokens)
  - Use of HTTPS for all network communication
- **Installation/Update Checks:** Confirm clean installs, updates from older versions, and complete uninstalls

### ü§ñ 4. Automation Strategy
- **Automation Candidates:** Automate key user flows (login, main features) for regression coverage
- **Tooling Choices:**
  - **Appium:** Cross-platform automation for iOS and Android
  - **XCUITest:** For iOS-native deep testing
  - **Espresso:** For fast Android testing with native integration

## üîç 4. Using Charles Proxy for Mobile App Testing

### üõ† Setup Steps:
1. **Install Charles Proxy** on your desktop: [https://www.charlesproxy.com/](https://www.charlesproxy.com/)
2. Connect your mobile device and desktop to the **same WiFi network**
3. On desktop: Go to `Proxy ‚Üí Proxy Settings` and note the port (default: 8888)
4. On mobile:
   - Go to WiFi settings ‚Üí Modify network ‚Üí Set manual proxy
   - IP address: Your desktop IP
   - Port: 8888
5. Trust Charles SSL certificate:
   - On desktop: `Help ‚Üí SSL Proxying ‚Üí Install Charles Root Certificate`
   - On mobile: Open `[http://charlesproxy.com/getssl](http://chls.pro/ssl)` in browser and install the certificate (needed for HTTPS)

### üîç What You Can Do:

#### 1. Viewing and Inspecting Traffic
- See every API call the app makes, including headers, payloads, status codes, and timings
- **Verify API Calls:** Confirm correct endpoints and parameters
- **Debug UI Issues:** Reveal real backend error messages
- **Security Check:** Ensure sensitive data is sent securely and no secrets are leaked

#### 2. Network Throttling
- Simulate poor network conditions: slow 3G, flaky 4G, high latency
- **Test UI behavior:** Validate use of loading indicators
- **Timeout Handling:** Ensure the app responds gracefully to timeouts
- **Data Optimization:** Check if large resources (e.g., images) are efficiently loaded

#### 3. Breakpoints and Modifying Requests/Responses
- Intercept and modify data before it reaches the app/server
- **Edge Cases:** Manually test rare input combinations
- **Error Simulation:** Force custom server errors (e.g., 500, 403)
- **Layout Validation:** Inject long text, special characters, or invalid content

#### 4. SSL Proxying (HTTPS Decryption)
- Decrypt and inspect HTTPS traffic using Charles's root certificate
- Enables visibility into secure API traffic

#### 5. Map Remote and Rewrite Tools
- **Map Remote:** Redirect traffic to a staging/dev server without modifying the app
- **Rewrite Tool:** Automatically modify headers, query parameters, or response data
