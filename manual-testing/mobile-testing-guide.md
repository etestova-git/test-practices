## üîç 1. How to Choose Mobile Devices

### ‚úÖ Key Criteria:
- **OS Versions:** Test across different major versions of Android and iOS (e.g., iOS 17, Android 14, etc.)
- **Device Models:** Prioritize popular and widely used devices (check market data)
- **Screen Sizes & Resolutions:** Include both small and large screen sizes to test responsive behavior
- **Hardware Capabilities:** Devices with different RAM, CPU, and GPU capabilities
- **Manufacturers & Brands:** Samsung, Google Pixel, Xiaomi, OnePlus, iPhone (multiple generations)
- **Network Types:** Test over WiFi, 3G, 4G, 5G to simulate real usage

### üì± Compatibility Testing
- **Device Coverage:** Define a "device matrix" in collaboration with the Product Manager based on analytics. Include top devices like iPhones, Samsung Galaxy, and Google Pixel with OS versions such as iOS 15‚Äì17 and Android 12‚Äì14.
- **Screen Size & Resolution:** Ensure no layout issues on small and large screens.
- **Execution Strategy:** Combine physical devices with cloud testing farms (e.g., Sauce Labs, BrowserStack) for broader coverage.

---
- Cloud tools of real devices **Firebase Test Lab**, **BrowserStack**, **Sauce Labs**.
- Maintain a **device matrix** for the product or a fiture.

## üß™ 2. Emulators vs. Simulators

### üíª Emulators (Android)
- Mimic both software and hardware of real Android devices
- Provided by Android Studio (AVD Manager)
- Good for functional and UI testing
- Slower than real devices

### üì± Simulators (iOS)
- Simulate the iOS environment (software only)
- Provided by Xcode
- Cannot test hardware-specific features (e.g., camera, GPS)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations:
- **No real hardware behavior** (e.g., CPU throttling, battery drain)
- **No realistic performance data**
- **Limited support for gesture, touch, and physical sensors**

### ‚úÖ Use Real Devices For:
- Final verification
- Performance and battery testing
- Hardware-specific feature testing

## üß© 3. What to Test in Mobile Apps

### ‚úÖ 1. Functional Testing
- Ensure the app behaves as expected.
- Navigation between screens
- Input field validation
- Button actions and links
- Business logic (e.g., calculations, workflows)
- API responses and error handling
- File uploads/downloads
- Push notifications behavior

### ‚úÖ 2. UI/UX Testing

- Verify visual consistency and usability.
- Layouts on different screen sizes/resolutions
- Fonts, colors, icons, spacing
- Touch responsiveness (tap, swipe, pinch, drag)
- Accessibility (labels, ARIA roles, screen reader compatibility)
- Orientation changes (portrait ‚Üî landscape)

### ‚úÖ 3. Cross-Platform Testing

- Test across different OS and device types.
- iOS vs. Android
- Phones vs. tablets
- Different OS versions (e.g., Android 12, iOS 17)
- Device-specific behaviors (camera, sensors, back button)

### ‚úÖ 4. Performance Testing

- Check app speed and resource usage.
- App launch time
- Memory and battery consumption
- Scrolling smoothness and frame rates
- Response time for user actions and API calls
- Handling large data sets or images

### ‚úÖ 5. Network Testing

- Ensure proper behavior under different network conditions.
- 3G, 4G, 5G, Wi-Fi, airplane mode
- Handling slow or lost connections
- Retry logic for failed requests
- Offline mode support

### ‚úÖ 6. Security Testing

- Protect user data and prevent vulnerabilities.
- Secure login/authentication (e.g., OAuth, biometrics)
- Data encryption (at rest and in transit)
- No sensitive data stored in logs or cache
- Certificate pinning, HTTPS enforcement
- In-app permissions handling

### ‚úÖ 7. Localization Testing

- Verify language and region-specific content.
- Translations of all UI elements
- Number/date/time/currency formats
- Text expansion in different languages (e.g., German vs. English)

### ‚úÖ 8. Installation and Upgrade Testing

- Ensure app setup and updates work smoothly.
- First-time install
- Update from older versions
- Clean uninstall and reinstall
- Handling corrupted installation

### ‚úÖ 9. Push Notification Testing

- Check messaging behavior.
- Receiving and tapping notifications
- Foreground, background, and killed app states
- Action buttons and deep linking
- Opt-in/opt-out handling

### ‚úÖ 10. Crash and Recovery Testing

- Ensure app stability and error recovery.
- App doesn‚Äôt crash on invalid inputs
- Recover gracefully from unexpected behavior
- Logs collected for debugging
- ANR (Application Not Responding) scenarios

### üìù Optional: Additional Areas

- Battery drain in long use
- App store compliance (Apple, Google)
- Analytics and tracking validation
- Third-party integrations (payment gateways, social login)
- Accessibility compliance (for WCAG standards)
  
### ü§ñ 4. Automation Strategy
- **Automation Candidates:** Automate key user flows (login, main features) for regression coverage
- **Tooling Choices:**
  - **Appium:** Cross-platform automation for iOS and Android
  - **XCUITest:** For iOS-native deep testing
  - **Espresso:** For fast Android testing with native integration

## üîç 4. Using Charles Proxy for Mobile App Testing

### üõ† Setup Steps:
1. **Install Charles Proxy** on your desktop: [https://www.charlesproxy.com/](https://www.charlesproxy.com/)
2. Connect your mobile device and desktop to the **same WiFi network**
3. On desktop: Go to `Proxy ‚Üí Proxy Settings` and note the port (default: 8888)
4. On mobile:
   - Go to WiFi settings ‚Üí Modify network ‚Üí Set manual proxy
   - IP address: Your desktop IP
   - Port: 8888
5. Trust Charles SSL certificate:
   - On desktop: `Help ‚Üí SSL Proxying ‚Üí Install Charles Root Certificate`
   - On mobile: Open `[http://charlesproxy.com/getssl](http://chls.pro/ssl)` in browser and install the certificate (needed for HTTPS)

### üîç What You Can Do:

#### 1. Viewing and Inspecting Traffic
- See every API call the app makes, including headers, payloads, status codes, and timings
- **Verify API Calls:** Confirm correct endpoints and parameters
- **Debug UI Issues:** Reveal real backend error messages
- **Security Check:** Ensure sensitive data is sent securely and no secrets are leaked

#### 2. Network Throttling
- Simulate poor network conditions: slow 3G, flaky 4G, high latency
- **Test UI behavior:** Validate use of loading indicators
- **Timeout Handling:** Ensure the app responds gracefully to timeouts
- **Data Optimization:** Check if large resources (e.g., images) are efficiently loaded

#### 3. Breakpoints and Modifying Requests/Responses
- Intercept and modify data before it reaches the app/server
- **Edge Cases:** Manually test rare input combinations
- **Error Simulation:** Force custom server errors (e.g., 500, 403)
- **Layout Validation:** Inject long text, special characters, or invalid content

#### 4. SSL Proxying (HTTPS Decryption)
- Decrypt and inspect HTTPS traffic using Charles's root certificate
- Enables visibility into secure API traffic

#### 5. Map Remote and Rewrite Tools
- **Map Remote:** Redirect traffic to a staging/dev server without modifying the app
- **Rewrite Tool:** Automatically modify headers, query parameters, or response data
